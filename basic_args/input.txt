The WordCount examples demonstrate how to set up a processing pipeline that can
read text, tokenize the text lines into individual words, and perform a
frequency count on each of those words. The Beam SDKs contain a series of these
four successively more detailed WordCount examples that build on each other. The
input text for all the examples is a set of Shakespeareâ€™s texts.
